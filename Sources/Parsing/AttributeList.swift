/**
 [4.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8216#section-4.2)

 An AttributeValue is one of the following:

 *  decimal-integer: an unquoted string of characters from the set
 [0..9] expressing an integer in base-10 arithmetic in the range
 from 0 to 2^64-1 (18446744073709551615).  A decimal-integer may be
 from 1 to 20 characters long.

 *  hexadecimal-sequence: an unquoted string of characters from the
 set [0..9] and [A..F] that is prefixed with 0x or 0X.  The maximum
 length of a hexadecimal-sequence depends on its AttributeNames.

 *  decimal-floating-point: an unquoted string of characters from the
 set [0..9] and '.' that expresses a non-negative floating-point
 number in decimal positional notation.

 *  signed-decimal-floating-point: an unquoted string of characters
 from the set [0..9], '-', and '.' that expresses a signed
 floating-point number in decimal positional notation.

 *  quoted-string: a string of characters within a pair of double
 quotes (0x22).  The following characters MUST NOT appear in a
 quoted-string: line feed (0xA), carriage return (0xD), or double
 quote (0x22).  Quoted-string AttributeValues SHOULD be constructed
 so that byte-wise comparison is sufficient to test two quoted-
 string AttributeValues for equality.  Note that this implies case-
 sensitive comparison.

 *  enumerated-string: an unquoted character string from a set that is
 explicitly defined by the AttributeName.  An enumerated-string
 will never contain double quotes ("), commas (,), or whitespace.

 *  decimal-resolution: two decimal-integers separated by the "x"
 character.  The first integer is a horizontal pixel dimension
 (width); the second is a vertical pixel dimension (height).
